# dFC
An implementation of several well-known dynamic Functional Connectivity assessment methods.

Simply do these steps in the main repository directory to learn how to use the dFC functions:
  * `conda create --name multi_analysis_dfc_env python=3.8.5`
  * `conda activate multi_analysis_dfc_env`
  * `pip install -e '.'`
  * run the code cells in demo jupyter notebooks

The `dFC_methods_demo.ipynb` illustrates how to load data and apply each of the implemented dFC methods individually.
The `multi_analysis_demo.ipynb` illustrates how to use the `multi_analysis_dfc` toolbox to apply multiple dFC methods at the same time on a dataset and compare their results.

For more details about the implemented methods and the comparison analysis see [our paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.13.548883v2)
